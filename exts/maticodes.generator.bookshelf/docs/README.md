# Bookshelf Generator

A procedural modeling tool for creating bookshelves with arrayed books. You can set parameters like height, width, and number
of shelves to control the generator. The extension comes with a sample book asset or you can use your own books or props
as prototypes for the PointInstancer.

## Usage
1. Press the `Create New` button to create a new bookshelf.
2. Expand the Prototypes collapsible frame and click `Create Default Prototypes`. Optionally, you can provide your own prototypes.
    1. NOTE: Prototype targets should be an Xform and the pivot should be centered on the bottom of the model.
3. Set the rest of the parameters.
4. Click `Generate`. You can change the parameters and click `Generate` again to regenerate.

**NOTE:** Use the combobox to select a different bookshelf in the stage to operate on.   
**NOTE:** Use the `Reload` button to refresh the combobox.
